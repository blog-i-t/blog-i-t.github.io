                        If you’re new to flying a drone and want to get the most out of your footage you’re in the right place. Over the course of using multiple drones and filming countless videos I’ll be sharing with you my favorite tips!
                        Every photographers knows the importance of getting high quality footage from their gear and a drone is no exception. Here are 10 tips to improve your drone videos (and drone photos as well!) 
                        Improve your drone videography with these 3 drone filming tips.I hope these drone video tips improve your videos.
                        It’s surprising how many people aren’t aware of the rule of thirds. My brother got his first camera recently and wasn’t aware of that…, it’s also applicable for video shoots!

                    <h1>1. Change Your Gimbal Sensitivity</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things you might notice while filming with your drone is how quick the gimbal pitch speed is. DJI drones by default have a high sensitivity set for their gimbals out of the box.

To change your gimbal sensitivity on a DJI drone you go into Advanced Settings and modify the gimbal pitch speed and smoothness. This is easily one of my favorite drone videography tips when using a DJI drone. Play with the settings to find a smoothness you like but anything is improvement over the quick default settings.

On newer DJI drones enabling cinematic mode will also decrease gimbal sensitivity.

                    <h1>2. Use Simple Angles While Filming</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of drone filming techniques but the more tilts and twists you do while filming will take your viewer out of the moment. When recording a video on your drone I recommend using simple paths and angles. Simple sweeping and reveal shots will keep your viewer engaged and not make them think they are watching drone footage.
